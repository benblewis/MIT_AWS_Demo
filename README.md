This GitHub repository holds the code and data used in the AWS + MIT Criminal Justice Data Analysis Demo

In this demo, we will use police stop data from New York City in 2013. We'll walk you through how to access the data, how explore the data through tables and data visualizations, and how to uncover potential racial biases.
