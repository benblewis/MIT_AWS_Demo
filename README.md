Bias in the criminal justice system can lead to poor decision making, leaving lasting impacts on individuals' lives. The Policing Lab at MIT's Initiative on Combatting Systemic Racism (ICSR) is dedicated to making dispatcher info, police stop info, and criminal sentencing data publicly available for professors, students, researchers, and anyone else interested in using these data to reduce bias in the field of criminal justice. With the help of Amazon Web Services (AWS), were doing just that.

To get a better understanding of the type of anaylsis one can do with this data, we've put together a demonstration using real police stop records from NYC.

In this demo, we will use police stop data from New York City in 2018. We'll walk you through how to:

1. Access the data in a GitHub Repository
2. Explore the data through tables and data visualizations
3. How to uncover potential racial biases using PCA

## The Data
We will be using the "sqf-2013.csv" file in our analysis, which contains important features, like arrest borough, race of suspect, alleged crime committed, and the type of force used by the officer.
